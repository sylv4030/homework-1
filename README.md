## Changed divs to semantic tags
Changed many of the div tags to semantic tags to show the type of section rather than a generic div tag for everything. These tags included heading, section, aside, figure, footer. Added a comment before each change.

Added a main section and a footer section using their descriptive tags to replace divs.

### Added more description to the title and images and ordered the headings

I added a descriptive title to the page and added alt tags to images. Also changed to heading in the footer from h2 to h4 to make it lower in importance than the other headings.
